        Throughout this assignment, I used AI-powered tools such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to assist with coding and problem-solving. 
        I found that Copilot was very efficient in suggesting small code snippets, particularly for common JavaScript patterns, but struggled with more structured concepts like Alpine.js-specific data binding.

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        ChatGPT, on the other hand, was extremely useful when debugging errors and improving CSS styling. 
        It was able to generate working Alpine.js data structures, refactor JavaScript logic, and even suggest better API structuring.
        However, Copilot sometimes provided responses that required heavy modification, especially when working with Tailwind CSS utilities.

    <p class="text-gray-700">
        Overall, AI tools were helpful, but they still required human oversight. 
        ChatGPT provided better step-by-step explanations, whereas Copilot excelled at inline code suggestions. 
        If I were to choose one for future projects, I’d lean towards ChatGPT for structured development and Copilot for quick completions.<br /><br />

        Some of the prompts that I used: <br />
        1) How do I fetch data from an external JSON API using Alpine.js? <br /><br />
        
        Response - It gave me a step-by-step method to follow on how I can fetch data from an external JSON API using Alpine.js which was quite helpful.<br /><br />

        2) What's the best way to structure multiple API calls in JavaScript? <br /><br />

        Response - It gave a 3 approach detailed explanation for different API all usages which were again helpful.<br /><br />

        3) Alpine.js fetch works but doesn't update my UI – how do I fix this?<br /><br />

        Response - It gave me some possible errors that I could have made and also some good error fixes which significantly helped me in figuring out errors in short amount of time.
